          <p>
            <b>I used to be a pack rat.</b> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
          </p>
          <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. </p>
          <h2>How I turned things around </h2>
          <p>
            <b>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</b> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. 
          </p>
          <h2>Now I live the simple life</h2>
          <p>
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With how much it turned my life around, <b>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</b>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
